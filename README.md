# MX5 Hybrid Dash

Just for fun I wanted to build a 'Hybrid Dash' or 'Hybrid Instrument Cluster' for my 2000' MX-5 NB. Hybrid means, that I want to upgrade the OEM instrument cluster to contain some displays and be overall smarter WITHOUT destroying the charm of it. The difference to version 1 is that I drop the RPI4 and the Arduino. Instead everything will be combined on a single PCB and the logic will be handled by a STM32 or ESP32 microcontroller. Furthermore the VR conditioner board will be merged onto the PCB. We plan to integrate the PCB inside the cluster, if possible.
This branch contains version 2 of the project. As we do not ordered the PCB yet, I could not yet test its functionality in my car. Please not that this is still under development. I am currently designing the circuit and the PCB layout.
This repo contains everything I gathered, used (and saved...). It contains a KiCad project with the PCB and in the future the C/C++ firmware I will develop for the STM32/ESP32.

## Demo Pictures

This section contains some demo pictures so you get an idea of what I actually did. Note that these images are work-in-progress and do NOT represent the finished version!

1. Image of a partially assembled cluster. The GUI is from version 1 and will probably look different in version 2.

2. One of the displays in a mount (note, the display in the image is broken!)

3. The same display from the back

## Information about the folders and their content

Below I will list them and give some brief information about them and their content:
1. **Gathered Documents** -- Contains files I found, saved and/or created myself
    - **2000_miata_mx5.pdf** -- Is a manual for a 2000 mx5 which contains all kinds of wiring datagrams etc. It has many useful information (about the instrument cluster. See page 28 & 30)
    - **BackOfInstrumentCluster.png** -- An image of the back of my instrument cluster
    - **ClusterConnectorsLayout-From2000Manual.png** -- A screenshot of the layout of the connectors which sit at the back of the cluster. Its copied from the file '2000_miata_mx5.pdf'
    - **displayRequirements.txt** -- A brief description of what the project features should be and possible improvements & ideas
    - **ImageOfClusterConnectors.jpg** -- An image of the clusters which sit at the back of the clusters
    - **InstrumentCluster_2005-MX-5.pdf** -- Contains information about the cluster, the fuel level sensor and more
    - **NumberedBackOfInstrumentCluster.jpeg** -- The image just with some numbers so you can identify which connector has which number/index
    - **PossibleTempSensorValues.txt** -- Possible temperature sensor values and the corresponding temperature in degree celcius
    - **RPMTestData.xlsx** -- Roughly measured VSS output values, the corresponding RPM and a way to calculate the RPM from the measured frequency.
2. **PCB** -- Contains the KiCad project of the PCB
3. **STM32** -- Contains the STM32CubeMX Project and in the future the firmware of the PCB

## 3D Models & Additional Information

I designed the display mounts myself with the free-to-use websoftware "OnShape". You can find the 3D model [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/e7f03f8bc2dd589c93d10406/w/4d8f17b09202eb8b20daf352/e/a5ddfcce33940dbfa6af1e26?renderMode=0&uiState=66dc995cdcc2976b5f7d5d22). In this OnShape project you can find the bracket and a "cover" which is glued to the top of it. Note: Im not satisfied with it being glued but at the moment I do not have an alternative solution.

Below I will "dump" some links to blogs, threads etc. which contain useful information I used:
- [A thread](https://forum.miata.net/vb/showthread.php?t=780170) I created to gather information around this project.
- [The used displays](https://www.waveshare.com/1.28inch-LCD-Module.htm) which I bought from amazon. They are manufactured by 'WaveShare' and have a screen size of 1.28"
- [Information about the oil gauge](https://www.waveshare.com/1.28inch-LCD-Module.htm)
- [Information about the water temperature relative to the resistance measured](https://www.miataturbo.net/megasquirt-18/water-temo-gauge-thermistor-values-74383/)
- [JLCPCB - A PCB manufacturar](https://jlcpcb.com/)
- [Circuit designer](http://falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html) to test small,simple circuits and their behavior
- [3D Model of bracket for a display](https://makerworld.com/en/models/437158#profileId-342358) which inspired my design. It made creating the "claw" mechanism which holds the display into place way easier!
