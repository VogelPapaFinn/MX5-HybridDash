- Communication via USB: Arduino connected and powered by RaspberryPi
- Baudrate: 115200
- Databits: 8
- Parity: None
- Stopbit: 1
- The Arduino only sends the measured data. It does NOT interpret or convert them

Arduino communication layout:
- Every 'command' is seperated via ';'
- Begin of transmission should specify the type: "DATA" or "DEBUG"
	- "DATA" -> Input for the RaspberryPi which contains (new) data
	- "DEBUG" -> Used for debugging. RaspberryPi will output it via 'qDebug()'
- Content of transmission: "NAME=VALUE"
	- The name is always in capital letters
- End of transmission: "END"

Allowed variable names and their meaning:
- "RPM": The cycle time of the square wave output, which represents the RPM
- "SPEED": The cycle time of the square wave output, which represents the speed (1000 pulses mean one driven km)
- "FUEL": The measured resistance value which represents the fuel level
- "TEMP": The measured resistance value which represents the coolant temperature
- "OILP":  The measured resistance value which represents the oil pressure (switch)
